				<h1>About</h1>
				<h3 class="first">Our Goal As a Company</h3>
				<p>
					Our Goal at Stinkin Good Compostin is to cleanse the world of waste and use it to build to a better future. Rather than just throwing away our leftover food, our mission is to take that and put it back into the world to further elevate Mother Nature. When we're finished, everyone will have a smile on their face as the outdoors will be cleaner and the Earth will be healthier.
				</p>
				<h3>Why Would Someone Purchase Our Service?</h3>
				<p>
					Food waste is gross. It's sticky and icky and just nasty. We at Stinkin Good Compostin know that you don't want that laying around anywhere, but fortunately enough we want to take it away from you!
				</p>
				<h3>Why Not Just Throw The Food Away?</h3>
				<p>
					Have you ever thought about what happens to your food when it disapears? It doesn't just vanish you silly goose, that muck gets dumped into landfills all over the world making the Earth dirtier and more cluttered each day. When we compost, that food gets put right back into the Earth to make way and pave the road for new, healthy plants and life to come.
